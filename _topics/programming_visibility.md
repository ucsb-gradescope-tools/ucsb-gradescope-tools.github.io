The four options for `visibility` in Gradescope are:
* `hidden`
* `after_due_date`
* `after_published`, and 
* `visible` (the default)

They documented on [Gradescope's own autograder documentation](https://gradescope-autograders.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specs/#controlling-test-case-visibility).

They are specified differently in various autograder formats.

# diffs.sh based format (UCSB Specific)

See the [README.md section](https://github.com/ucsb-gradescope-tools/gs-diff-based-testing/blob/master/README.md#reference) tha describes the annotations.

# TODO: Fill this in for Python, Java and tddFuncs for C++
