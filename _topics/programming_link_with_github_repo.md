The following repo is a tool developed at UCSB on the advice of Gradescope's documnentation for it's programming assignment product.  
It provides a way to create an Autograder.zip file that will automatically pull the graded assignment from a repo each time 
an assignment is graded.  This allows the instructor to update the assignment simply by updating the repo, without having
to create a new `Autograder.zip` file each time.
