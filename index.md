We support several approaches to autograding with gradescope:

|----------|--------|---------|
| Python   | `unittest` |  TODO: Insert link to example here | 
| C++      | `tddFuncs.h` |  TODO: Insert link to example here | 
| Python   | diff (Python script)|  TODO: Insert link to example here | 
| C++      | diff (Python script)|  TODO: Insert link to example here | 
| Python   | diff based (bash script)|  TODO: Insert link to example here | 
| C++      | diff based (bash script)|  TODO: Insert link to example here | 

We also support a way of linking a Gradescope autograder.zip file to a Github repo, via the [link-gs-zip-with-repo](https://github.com/ucsb-gradescope-tools/link-gs-with-repo) tool.

Notes:
* `tddFuncs.h` is a  unit testing library for C++ developed locally at UCSB by Phill Conrad, and used in several assignments in CMPSC 16,24 and 32.
